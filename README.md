## Project Flow

Please use the following project flow, since we're still working on guardrails to make the experience better and the website more robust.
By A5 we plan to have the website sufficiently robust that these instructions won't be necessary.

1) Type in a city in the U.S. (just the city, i.e. Irvine)
2) Press the search button

If you don't type in a city and just press search, the API will default to Irvine
